# Development Environment:

    > Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS
    > Programming Language: C
    > Compiler: GCC or any C99 compliant compiler

# To compile and run the source code:

    1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the source code is located.

    2. Run the following command to compile the code:
    `
        gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
    `

    > This will create an executable file called "fibonacci" in the current directory.

    3. Run the following command to execute the program:
    `
        ./fibonacci
    `

    > This will run the program and print the output on the terminal window.

    4. If you want to run the test cases, you can use the following command.
    `
        ./fibonacci -t
    `
    > This will run the test cases and print the output on the terminal window.

Note:

    > Make sure you have GCC or any C99 compliant compiler installed on your system before running the above commands.

    > You can also use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Eclipse to run the program and test cases with proper debugging support.

    > The program is designed to output the fibonacci sequence based on the arithmetic operation specified in the TypeTag enumeration. As stated before the fibonacci sequence is a mathematical definition and the operation of the sequence can not be altered.
