# Development Environment:
    > Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS
    > Programming Language: C
    > Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

# Compiling and Running the Code:
    1. Open a terminal in your operating system
    2. Navigate to the directory where the code is saved
    3. Compile the code using the following command:
    `
    gcc -o output_file_name file_name.c

    `
    For example, if the file name is "fibonacci.c", the command will be:
    `
        gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c

    `
    4. Run the compiled code by typing the following command:
    `
        ./output_file_name
    `
    For example, if the output file name is "fibonacci", the command will be:
    `
        ./fibonacci
    `
    5. The program will prompt you to enter a number, enter the number you want to calculate the F(n) value of and press enter
    6. The program will output the calculated F(n) value

    Note: make sure that you have GCC compiler installed on your system, if not you can install it by following the instructions on this website https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html

    Also, you can use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse to run the code, in this case, you can use the built-in compiler and you don't have to use the command line.
